## Audio Feature Based Music Genre Classification Using Machine Learning Models

Music information retrieval (MIR) has been an active field of research for the past decade, especially in retrieving music genre information as genre classification for music files during distribution are still reliant on manual annotations. The purpose of this research is to determine the best set of hyper parameters for the best performing machine learning models in classifying music genres based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) audio features. The paper also explores the best feature selection techniques to be used in tandem with the best performing machine learning models. From the results, it was found that the Extra Trees ensemble model yielded the highest accuracy among the 8 models implemented in this paper with an accuracy score of 68.5%. The greedy feature selection method provided the best accuracy improvements for the K-Nearest neighbors model, but reduced accuracy rates for Random Forest and Extra Trees models.
